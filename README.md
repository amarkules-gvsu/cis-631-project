# cis-631-project

To Do:
- Create 2 final data sets - one for linear, one for logistic
  - linear model data should have calories, portion size, total fat, total protein, total carbs, plus most common sup-categories of macros
  - logistic model should have food category plus lots of micronutrients

- get basic linear regression app working
  - just a way to select IVs and DV, a graph of the linear model with the data, model statistics
